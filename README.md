# SQL-Tableau-project
## Info
The aim of this project was to use SQL to execute queries retrieving relevant datasets from a fictional database. Then to export newly obtaiend datasets in a CSV file to be used in Tableau. Finally, create visualization in Tableau.
MySQL database management tool was used. 

## Guidelines
The dataset I have used is contaiend in a zip filed under a name employees_mod_database.zip. The dataset is clean and does not require preprocessing.
The database structure is presented in employees_mod_db.pdf.
The 4 business tasks and code execution is kept in SQL-code.sql file.
The query results have been divided into 4 seperate csv files, which have been exported to Tableau for further visualization.
The final dashboard is saved in Tableau-workbook.twbx.
